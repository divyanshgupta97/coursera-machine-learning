This repository contains my solutions for the programming assignments for the Introduction to Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng. I have made a concerted effort to vectorize all my code and use the native MATLAB/Octave functions over the for/while loop constructs. The solutions received 100% grading from the automatic grader.
